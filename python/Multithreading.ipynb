    "## _Locks_\n",
    "Locks are objects in Python that facilitates the implementation of *Synchronisation* between threads. For example, two threads that make transactions in a bank account. They have to access the same variable, but you don,t wan't the threads to access it at the same time, as it would cause errors. But you still want the code to be separated in threads, as they might do other stuff while waiting, or constantly updating the amount they will transfer. Hence, a _Lock_ will make a thread wait while an other thread has released it. There are two types of locks: the *threading.Lock()* and *threading.semaphore()*. The semaphore is just like a normal lock, but with more control over how many threads can acces a specific variable an so on. Here we present an example of a situation where a Lock() is needed. Two operations (addition and multiplication) must always be made in sequential order because for some reason, the value of one is dependent of the output of the other one."
