I'm not sure what you mean by a GUI button to launch your script.

Usually, a GUI requires to launch a python script to launch your GUI.
 If you want to launch a script by clicking on it, you can double click on your ".py"
  file if you have a system interpreter with all the desired packages and your code should run just fine.
