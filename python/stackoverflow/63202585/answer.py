Opening QtDesigner has nothing to do with your python version nor your IDE. This is most likely a corrupt installation
 or OS problem.

Try re-installing QtDesigner from this link: <https://build-system.fman.io/static/public/files/Qt%20Designer%20Setup.exe>
If it still doesn't work, it is most likely a C++ compiler error due to the `.dll` missing. Here's a video on how to
repair that error: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XJ8_kUjVlk>
